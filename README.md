# Wrapped For You
### Description
This is a personal spotify wrapped generating application created for my Objects and Design course. I worked with 5 other teammates to create this app. Our app was developed in Android Studio, with Java as our primary language and Firebase as our database. 
<br />
<br />
This app includes:
<br />
* Generating personal Spotify Wrapped summaries
* Viewing past Spotify Wrapped summaries
* Customizing timespan for generated summaries
* Playback functionalities for top songs directly within the app
* Updating login information
* Deleting user accounts
